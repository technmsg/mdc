<h1>Going Solar: The Bottom Line</h1>

<p>This is part of an <a href="/v2/solar/">ongoing essay</a> detailing my experiences with solar energy. To see if solar is right for you, visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y34p2jhu">SunPower</a>.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The bottom line is an ongoing and ever-evolving thing. Money will likely continue to go out to pay for electricity, although hopefully at reduced amounts. After all the one-time incentives are received, money should come in periodically from SREC sales.</p>

<h3>System</h3>

<p>The system, in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>sixteen (16) 245W SunPower SPR-245NE-WHT-U-240 panels <!-- http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/spec-sheets/sp-e-series-residential-solar-panels-supplementary-technical-spec.pdf --></li>
<li>a SunPower SPR-3801f-240 inverter <!-- http://us.sunpower.com/sites/sunpower/files/media-library/manuals/mn-spr-3301f-1-spr-3801f-1-spr-6501f-1-spr-7501f-1-spr-10001f-1-spr-11401f-1-spr-11401f-3-spr-12001f.pdf --></li>
</ul>

<p>The system is designed to produce 114,400 kWh over its 25-year service lifetime.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>All in, the system cost was <strong>$16,965</strong>. That includes panels, inverter, materials, permits, labor, monitoring, service, postage for grant applications, etc.</p>

<p>To date, I've received $12,718 back from numerous sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>$5,089 Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit (30% of system cost)</li>
<li>$1,283 Solar Equipment Property Tax Credit (one time)</li>
<li>$1,000 Residential Clean Energy Grant Program (one time)</li>
<li>$2,526 in utility bill reductions (from energy I generated rather than bought)</li>
<li>$1,148 in SREC proceeds</li>
<li>$1,000 in referral fees from Solar Energy World</li>
<li>$500 "thank you" gift card from <a href="https://www.solarenergyworld.com/">Solar Energy World</a></li>
<li>$128 in credit from power production warranty</li>
<li>$44 in utility generation credits</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes my out-of-pocket cost <strong>$4,246</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm still expecting the following credits:</p>

<ul>
<li>ongoing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificate">SREC</a> proceeds</li>
<li>ongoing utility bill reductions</li>
<li>potential credits from the power production warranty</li>
</ul>

<p>At install time, my out-of-pocket cost after all government incentives was estimated to be $5,335.</p>

<p>After receiving a smaller property tax credit than expected (due to vagaries of how the credit is calculated), my out-of-pocket cost was recalculated to be $6,552. In practice, income from SREC sales varies depending on market conditions, and the ongoing utility bill reductions continue to chip away at that outlay.</p>

<p>To date the IRS hasn't allowed for any exceptions to be made for SREC payments. Although I've yet to receive a 1099 from Sol Systems, I still report the payments as income on my tax return (and pay tax on them accordingly).</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>

<p>Since installation and activation (about 72 months ago), my solar PV system has generated about 23,000 kWh.</p>

<h4>After Three Months</h4>

<p>In the first billing month, the system generated a mere 10% of my electrical needs, in part due to a end-of-cycle install in the middle of winter. We had some particularly snowy days where it took a day or two for the snow to melt and slide off the panels.</p>

<p>In the second month, the system generated 45% and then in the third month produced 79% of my needs. As the days grow longer and grey skies begin to clear, production will continue to increase.</p>

<p>In the third month, the system generated 143% resulting in a zeroed bill and nice credit from my utility company. BGE does a true-up at the end of April, and I received a check for the accrued generation.</p>

<h4>After Six Months</h4>

<p>After six months the system continues to generate a steady stream of electricity, usually more than I need on a daily basis. I expect the accrued credit balance with the utility should help even out the high-usage over the summer and the upcoming slowing production of fall and winter.</p>

<p>Since installation, the system has generated more than 86% of my electrical needs.</p>

<h4>After One Year</h4>

<p>Electrical production increased considerably throughout the summer, resulting in several negative "credit" bills from BGE. The accrued credit balance was consumed once the air conditioning was turned on, but the longer summer days still ended up producing 71-82% of my need.</p>

<p>Between incentives, reduction of utility payments, and the income from SREC sales, I have have recouped more than 50% of my investment. With no additional large incentives due, the pay-down process will slow considerably. I still expect SREC sales and monthly utility reductions.</p>

<h4>After Two Years</h4>

<p>My thoughts after two years with solar panels have been moved to a dedicated <a href="/v2/2017/02/07/solar-two-years.html">Two Years with Solar</a> page.</p>

<h4>After Six Years</h4>

<p>My thoughts after six years with solar panels have been moved to a dedicated <a href="/v2/2021/01/17/solar-six-years.html">Six Years with Solar</a> page.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>In winter 2015 I experienced <a href="/v2/solar/inverter-replacement.html">an odd hardware failure</a> after a particularly cold and nasty ice storm, where the inverter wouldn't sync for a few days. Solar Energy World came out to troubleshoot, got in touch with SunPower, and replaced the inverter a few days later. Sometimes motherboards go bad or get confused, I guess.</p>

<p>I've seen the monitoring adapter stop reporting to SunPower. While it doesn't affect generation, the monitoring pages/apps are blank until I reboot the adapter (by unplugging it and plugging it back in again). The inverter appears to retain data from the previous day and the monitoring pages get filled in with the "missing" data. It's only happened twice.</p>

<p>In winter of 2016 a blizzard dropped more than 30 inches of snow in an afternoon. While the panels and roof stood up to the additional weight, an <a href="https://www.icedamcompany.com/about-ice-dams/">ice dam</a> formed on the rear of the house, in part due to the displacement of blown-in insulation during the installation process. As the ice melted it pushed the gutters away from the fascia board; after the ice dam was broken up the gutters and fascia receded, but needed to be repaired.</p>

<p>Sometime in 2020 started losing data about previous years production. The monitoring console suggested it was a temporary display problem and that data was still being collected and stored, however the problem still persists. It's an mild inconvenience, but the production meter is still the source of truth for SREC production figures.</p>
