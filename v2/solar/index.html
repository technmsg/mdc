<!-- summary: A multi-part essay about my experience buying and installing solar panels on my roof. -->

<h1>Going Solar</h1>

<p>This is my story.</p>

<p>I first looked at solar power in 2012. I requested a consultation from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Block_Off_the_Grid">One Block Off the Grid</a> but then became overwhelmed by career changes; the company has since been acquired by Pure Energies, so perhaps it was a good thing I didn't follow through. Oddly enough and slightly tangential, Pure Energies contacted me via email after my system was installed.</p>

<p>I don't know why I started looking again.</p>

<p>A friend of mine had gotten solar panels and the technology piqued my interest. I also liked the notion of reducing my energy footprint, my impact on the surrounding grid, and not having large electric bills.</p>

<p>This time around I followed through.</p>

<p>If you aren't interested in the story or contract details, the system specifications, price, and ongoing costs are detailed in <a href="/v2/solar/solar-ongoing.html">The Bottom Line</a>.</p>

<p>On with the story...</p>

<h2>The Talk</h2>

<p>I was invited to speak about my experience with solar energy at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in 2016. The <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/technmsg/powered-by-the-sun-62161877">presentation slides</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCeNer9F2wU">video</a> are available.</p>

<h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>

<p>From signing the contract it took 90 days before I could throw the breaker and start generating electricity.</p>

<p>One of the things I liked is that the process was very hands-off. Aside from signing the contract, writing a few checks, and sending an email here and there, <a href="https://www.solarenergyworld.com/">Solar Energy World</a> took care of everything else: filing for permits, interconnect application, SREC registration, etc. If you're in the market I'd recommend giving SEW a look (and let 'em know I referred you). You can also go directly to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y34p2jhu">SunPower</a> to see what options are available in your area.</p>

<p>Given the expected reduction in my utility bills and all the incentives, the expected break-even point is 6-7 years, after which point I have a fixed effective price per kWh for the bulk of my electric needs. Like any investment, there's the possibility it might not pan out, but I'm hoping. We'll see.</p>
