<h1>Going Solar: SunPower Inverter Replacement</h1>

<p>This is part of an <a href="/v2/solar/">ongoing essay</a> detailing my experiences with solar energy. To see if solar is right for you, visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y34p2jhu">SunPower</a>.</p>

<h2>Odd Inverter Failure</h2>

<p>The evening of Saturday, February 14th, 2014 there was an unexpected snow storm which later turned to freezing rain accompanied by gale force winds.</p>

<p>The following day there was no solar production at all. There was a bit of ice on the panels from the night before, but most of it had melted by early afternoon.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the panels were clear of ice and snow but production was still flatlined; the web-based monitor displayed the "inverter(s) down" and the inverter showed a STATE 457 SYNC AC error w/ an orange LED. If I turned off the AC circuit breakers the inverter would change to STATE 445 and a red LED. These error messages are buried within the SunPower documentation, but aren't easily found using Google. Cycling the utility disconnect and DC disconnect had no effect. I phoned Solar Energy World and a service call was scheduled for the following day.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, a SEW technician came out to the house. He was able to verify that DC power was being produced by the panels (good), repeated most of the power cycling steps I had taken (OK), and also reseated the controller card within the inverter (why not, works for computer memory). After a call with SunPower it was decided to replace the whole inverter under warranty care.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, the inverter came back online, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The inverter got replaced anyways a few days later, under warranty. The whole swap took a few hours, but didn't require me to be home or to fiddle with any of the existing mount points to the walls or roof.</p>
