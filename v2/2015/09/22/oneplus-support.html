<h1>A Story of OnePlus Support</h1>

<p>I bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_One">OnePlus One</a> (OPO) on January 23rd, 2015.</p>

<p>I didn't really need it, but I had received an invite code and I knew that my aging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_4">Nexus 4</a> would need to be refreshed eventually. I liked the idea of trying out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod">CyanogenMod</a> without having to flash my primary phone, so I figured <em>what the hell</em>.</p>

<p>When it arrived, I marveled at its size. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/20415322173/in/album-72157657793043989/">The OPO is big</a>. Impressively lightweight given it's dimensions, but big. So after booting it once to make sure it worked, I returned it to its original packaging and put it on the shelf.</p>

<p>I didn't start using my OPO until August 6th, almost eight months after I first received it. After acclimating to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod#Cyanogen_OS">Cyanogen OS</a>, things were great.</p>

<h2>Lights, Camera, Oh Crap...</h2>

<p>The camera was fast to capture, an improvement over the Nexus 4, which I find has some focus-to-shutter lag, but <strong>after a few days the rear camera stopped working.</strong> If I pulled up the camera app it'd just hang there -- controls visable but with a completely black preview screen -- then eventually display "Camera error: Can't connect to the camera" (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/20379823140/in/album-72157657793043989/">screenshot</a>) or crash.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/20379823140/in/album-72157657793043989/" title="Camera error"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/20379823140_040850b616.jpg" width="500" height="303" alt="Camera error"></a></p>

<p>If I was quick I could switch to the front camera and take pictures successfully, but upon switching back to the rear camera I'd experience the same problem. Trying to access the camera using different applications made no difference.</p>

<p>It felt like a hardware issue.</p>

<p>But I read through <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/forums/the-one/">the OPO forums</a>, sorted through all the cruft, just in case it was some weird firmware thing. I tried most of the fixes, but nothing worked, so I opened a case with <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/support">OnePlus Support</a>.</p>

<h2>OnePlus Support</h2>

<p>If you're considering returning a device to OnePlus, realize that the RMA process will take a while. In my case, it took about <em>five weeks</em> from filing the support case to receiving a new device.</p>

<p>I still had a viable Nexus 4, so aside from the hassle of migrating a few applications back I wasn't horribly inconvenienced. If I hadn't, I could have spent <em>three weeks</em> without a phone. If the OPO <em>is</em> you primary device, you might consider keeping an old handset around as a backup.</p>

<p>The rough outline of the RMA process:</p>

<ol>
<li>describe the problem</li>
<li>provide video of the problem</li>
<li>perform various troubleshooting steps</li>
<li>(attempted) remote troubleshooting session</li>
<li>re-flash the OPO with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxygenOS">OxygenOS</a> to rule our firmware issues</li>
<li>ship the device back to the United Kingdom via DHL</li>
<li>receive a new device, shipped from California</li>
</ol>

<p>Understandably it's in OnePlus' interest to rule out user error, software bugs, and firmware glitches before shipping a device to the United Kingdom at their expense. As such, you can expect to go through several tiers of troubleshooting just like you might when reporting a problem to your company's IT helpdesk. For technical folks, this will be frustrating.</p>

<p>Working across world time zones always adds some difficulties, especially in the form of delays. The OnePlus support process is no exception. Interaction with OnePlus support is almost entirely via <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a> email threads. I'd typically see responses late evening New York time, but also some mornings and weekends too. I did my best not to be the source of delay, but sometimes responses would arrive after I'd gone to bed, traveling without service, etc. Even if I replied as soon as I could, I suspect some of my responses wouldn't have been seen until their next business day.</p>

<p>Everyone was very polite. No complaints there, at all. At no point did any representative make me feel like an idiot.</p>

<p>The end result was a new device being shipped to me, albeit questionably packaged. The new camera worked out of the box, before and after upgrading to CM 12.1. Hopefully this one will stay that way.</p>

<h2>The Email Chain</h2>

<p>What follows is my 48-email interaction with OnePlus support, unchanged except for the redaction of accounts, case numbers, and other identifying information. I provide it so that others may know what they can expect from the OnePlus RMA process.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>There are certainly things that OnePlus could do to improve it's support offering, some of which I muse about in the ongoing (now non-)interior monologue. If you detect cynicism, skepticism, and concerns about security, you'd be absolutely correct.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a few days normal operation, the back camera stopped responding and
issued a "can't connect to the camera" error. The preview window remains dark
and the error appears. Periodically the camera controls appear and I'm able to
switch to front-camera which takes successful pictures/video, but the
application usually becomes unresponsive ("unfortunately, camera has stopped")
and I can't switch back to back-camera.</p>

<p>I have searched all the forums, tried everything else except flashing with a
new ROM (Oxygen, nightlies).</p>

<p>I have tried other camera applications (Google, Twitter, Flickr, etc) with no
change. I have tried clearing application caches, uninstalling all other
applications, rebooting, powering down for 10-12 hours, factory reset, and
factory reset with removal of all media/user-data.</p>

<p>Model: A0001 <br />
Cyanogen OS version: 12.0-YNG1TAS2I3 <br />
Android version: 5.0.2 <br />
Baseband version: DI.3.0.c6-00230-M8974AAAAANAZM-1 <br />
Kernel version: 3.4.67-cyanogenmod-gf34ed89 <br />
Build number: LRX22G</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I tried to provide all the information they would need, rather than bouncing back and forth for days. I'm not sure whether that's an artifact of me having worked a support desk before, common sense, or some mixture of all three.</p>

<p>Around the same time I had <a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_Support/status/632213812393975808">engaged support via Twitter</a> as well and they responded quickly with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
<li>Try to disable the NuPlayer from the Developer options and restart the phone.</li>
<li>Hold down the volume,power &amp; back buttons for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Please uninstall the app and reinstall it.</li>
<li>If still doesn't work, we better suggest to please perform a factory reset <a href="https://support.oneplus.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/323/">https://oneplus.net/support/answer/how-do-i-perform-a-full-factory-reset</a>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I appended the results (or lack thereof) following their advice to the case.</p>

<p>Good day! Welcome to Oneplus Global Support. I'm sorry about the issue(s) that
you're experiencing on your One. For us to be able to assist you, kindly
provide a:</p>

the assessment process. Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>This much maligned process has been discussed at length within the OnePlus forums, so I knew it was coming. So they wanted a video of me picking the camera app, seeing a blank screen, and waiting for the app to hang? Not sure how helpful that will be in diagnosing the issue, but I guess it'll serve as proof.</p>

<p>Rather than using a camera to do this, I used the stock screen capture app that comes with Cyanogen OS to "shoot" a couple videos. I uploaded them to Google Drive, nervously shared them with the world, and sent the links back.</p>

<p>Crap. Apparently the Google Apps domain I used didn't allow sharing with the world. Good thing in general, not so great here. Had to re-host the videos under a generic non-GA Gmail account.</p>

  <p>Hi Alex,</p>

<p>Thank you very much for providing us with these information. We're sorry to
know that you still have issues with you One. We understand that you have
already tried all basic troubleshooting steps and it still not working. In
order for us to check if it's a software issue, you may have to flash your
phone to Oxygen to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>To install OxygenOS on your OnePlus One, you need to flash the device. You may
follow the guidance of the latest update here: <br />

<p>Please also note that since OxygenOS is a product from OnePlus therefore it is
currently only available for OnePlus One.</p>

<p>Any question or problem please feel free to come back to OnePlus Support : )</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Ray</p>

<p>I had my doubts about:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether a new ROM would fix what I was <em>reasonably certain</em> was a hardware problem</li>
<li>leaving <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/oneplus-oxygen-vs-cyanogen-review/">Cyanogen OS in favor of Oxygen</a>, especially given the upcoming 12.1S OTA; if a software update can fix the thing, why not just wait for the OTA?</li>
<li>flashing a ROM and bricking the device</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance on the forum <em>appeared</em> to be from a OnePlus staff member but included the phrase "it's beta so it's not guaranteed to work." Not cool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To help me decide whether to flash a beta ROM (something I've never done), is
there an expected rollout for CM OS 12.1S via OTA update? now that OPT is
shipping, are we talking days, weeks, months?</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. We do apologize but haven't receive any
information yet from Cyanogen on when they will rollout the CM12.1s. With
regard to OPT, it will be on Oxygen since it is our official ROM.</p>

<p>Shipping a handset to Hong Kong? Meh. They're never the same once they're cracked and the possibility of getting back a refurbished unit is irritating too. At this point I'd rather just get a refund and buy a new one, hopefully one more recently off the factory line.</p>

<p>This was about the time I saw that Cyanogen had started rolling out <a href="https://cyngn.com/blog/cyanogen-os-12-1-dialed-in-turned-up">Cyanogen OS 12.1</a> via OTA update. I downloaded it manually and applied it via the stock bootloader.</p>

<p>Big surprise, it didn't fix the camera.</p>

<p>Later that night, I had a friend help me unlock the handset. We flashed <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygen-1-0-2-release-with-stagefright-security-patches.340711/">Oxygen OS 1.0.2</a> using <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-is-here-installation-guide.289398/">the OnePlus-provided instructions</a>. Oxygen OS is a very slim build of stock Android, very quick and responsive, but the problem with the camera remained.</p>

<p>I went to the web site and verified my shipping address. The "RMA status" changed from "Pending Verification" to "Verified" although there weren't any other indications of what was supposed to be happening. Based on email #32, I'm guessing that I'll be contacted with Pickup instructions?</p>

<p>Sending login details in an email. :-/</p>

<p>I packaged things up in an Amazon A3 box, well padded. Hopefully that's not "overly large."</p>

<p>When I went to create the appointment with DHL, the option to specify list Declarable Items wasn't even an option; I can only hope that these were generalized instructions and perhaps the form isn't required for US-to-UK shipments. I've filled it out anyways and will keep it when the courier arrives. The closest appointment was two days away, some time between 9 and 5.</p>

<p>DHL emails me the shipping label, on which is labeled "if you're using your own packaging, don't seal it, it needs to be inspected and sealed by the courier." Oops.</p>

<p>Pickup goes without a hitch. I receive a tracking number and the name and phone number of the local DHL driver.</p>

<p>Didn't I confirm my address two weeks ago? Does the RMA department not have access to the records I already updated?</p>

<p>Hmm, "the latest update from ?" looks like a mail merge error or problem with Zendesk templating, maybe the RMA folks <em>aren't</em> actually hooked into the support system.</p>

<p>So there <em>is</em> a tracking number. Turns out it was created shortly after my last interaction with jan ice and mailed Priority Mail 2-Day from California.</p>

<p>Not that it mattered much, my mail carrier had attempted to deliver it already. I wasn't home and the notice had fallen into the air gap between front door and storm door.</p>

<p>A signature was required, so I had to go to the local post office to collect the package.</p>

<p>The thing didn't appear to be well-wrapped, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/21591031892/in/album-72157657793043989/">OEM packaging</a> packed within a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/21415420759/in/album-72157657793043989/">thin cardboard box</a> stuffed into a standard <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/21415400869/in/album-72157657793043989/">bubble wrap envelope</a>. Certainly less cushioning than I sent old one out with, although this <em>may</em> be how the original was delivered.</p>

<p>The new OPO booted into CyanogenMod (not OxygenOS) and then almost immediately was upgraded to CyanogenOS 11.1. The camera worked. I upgraded to CM 12.1. The camera works. Hopefully it will continue to do so.</p>
