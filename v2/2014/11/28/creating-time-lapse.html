<h1>Creating Time-Lapse Video</h1>

<p>I've been shooting and stitching a lot of time-lapse frames together lately, in a variety of environments, a mix of business and pleasure. A few example videos from my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBm3S-aCMv3SLd0P5eUh_WxYY7ndEQMdL">YouTube playlist</a> follow.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCXOkGh14vI">Super Art Fight 100</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2cZ1iXeixE">Leaving Saint Thomas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laoMweE5Puk">Leaving Saint Maarten</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0VW5L6x6yE">Keep Calm and Gobble On</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Without any formal training, there was a lot of trial and error involved. What follows is the basic procedure I use to create time-lapse video.</p>

<h2>Collecting the Imagery</h2>

<p>I tend use the following gear:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F3F0EIU/?tag=v2mdc-20">GoPro HERO3+ Silver Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CSQYVWM/?tag=v2mdc-20">GoPro HERO3 Skeleton Housing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F19Q2R0/?tag=v2mdc-20">GoPro Jaws Flex Clamp Mount</a></li>
<li>USB power adapter</li>
</ul>

<p>The battery on the GoPro only lasts a couple hours, so the skeleton housing is key for long (read: 6-8 hours) shoots; just plug in AC power and you're good to go. It also protects the lens against spit, sweat, and splashed beverages, something the open frame can't provide.</p>

<p>I use the time-lapse function on the GoPro, the only settings I tweak are around image quality and interval.</p>

<h3>Image Quality</h3>

<p>5 MP images are more than sufficient for creating high-definition (1920x1080) videos for upload to YouTube, but they aren't super-wide, so I go with 7 MP.</p>

<p>10 MP images are too much, it creates extremely large (resolution) files that:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce the number of stills your camera can hold</li>
<li>increase the transfer time from the camera</li>
<li>creates larger intermediate video</li>
<li>end up being downsampled later, which takes longer</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to create 4K video you'll want to stick with the higher resolutions, although to date there really aren't a lot of platforms where you can tell the difference.</p>

<h3>Interval</h3>

<p>Calculating interval is a function of how long the final video needs to be and how smooth the motion needs to be. Most folks won't watch a video longer than a minute or two unless they're really engaged in the content or have something specific they're measuring (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KbXxE-7yao">foot traffic at a conference booth</a>). I aim for the final video being somewhere in the 1.5 to 2 minute range.</p>

<p>For landscapes the interval can be a lot longer than for people-motion, say 30-60 seconds. For people-motion I usually go with a 10 second interval, although for short clips I may go as low as 1 second. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0VW5L6x6yE">the turkey carving</a>, I knew it'd be a short session so I used a 0.5s interval. It's better to take more than less, since you can always drop every other frame before stitching.</p>

<p>There are plenty of time-lapse calculators available on the Internet, although I usually end up jotting down the figures by hand.</p>

<h2>Transferring the Images</h2>

<p>I transfer all the source files to an SSD-backed disk, one folder per video. The mini-USB connection feels slower than mounting the microSD card directly, although it usually isn't worth the hassle of removing the camera from the case.</p>

<h2>Stitching the Stills</h2>

<p><a href="http://zeitraffer.veronicasoft.com/">Zeitraffer</a> is a beautifully simple program that takes a folder full of stills and stitches them together, however many frames per second you choose. Zeitraffer is available from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zeitraffer/id572526628?mt=12">the Mac App Store</a>.</p>

<p>I usually use 30fps, but sometimes 24fps. I leave the other settings alone.</p>

<p>After processing, the result is a QuickTime video in 4:3 format.</p>

<h2>Formatting the Video</h2>

<p>To finish the thing, I use <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/">iMovie</a> to reformat/crop the video into 16:9 (as preferred by YouTube and modern televisions).</p>

<p>For comparison, consider this behind the scenes mixing video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rE8rKwFTs4">raw 4:3</a> versus the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPLruEuwIlc">cropped 16:9</a> version.</p>

<p>In iMovie:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a new project, 16:9 format, no template</li>
<li>File >> Import >> Movies…</li>
<li>create a new event</li>
<li>import the QuickTime video that Zeitraffer generated</li>
<li>crop the video down to 16:9 format</li>
<li>Share >> Export movie</li>
</ol>

<p>The result is a QuickTime video in 16:9 format, sans sound, but otherwise suitable for upload to YouTube.</p>

<h2>Adding Audio</h2>

<p>I usually find royalty-free music on YouTube and add it after-the-fact. Nothing fancy, there.</p>
