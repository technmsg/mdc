<h1>Six Years with Solar</h1>

<p>It's been six years since I <a href="/v2/solar/">installed solar panels on my roof</a> and things are still going great:</p>

<p>87% of my home's electricity needs have been provided by the sun.</p>

<p>75% of my installation costs have been recouped through incentives, reduced reliance on my utility's electric supply, SREC sales, and referral bonuses from my installer.</p>

<p>$0.18 per kilowatt-hour is my effective cost for electricity that the solar PV system has produced so far, including all taxes and fees. That rate is falling about one cent per quarter; if that trend continues the system could potentially pay itself off in another 4-5 years.</p>

<p>What else has happened?</p>

<p>Not much since <a href="/v2/2017/02/07/solar-two-years.html">my year two update</a>. I'm still very hands off, the system just silently does it's thing.</p>

<p>There's far more installs in my neighborhood now: a few dozen within a three minute walk of my house, and easily one hundred in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>That's the good news, but there have been a few hiccups.</p>

<h2>SREC Market Recovering</h2>

<p>In August 2015 the price of a single SREC was $165 but a year later it had dropped to $28. The price fell even further in 2017.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-markets/maryland-clean-energy-jobs-act-ceja-passes-into-law">passage of the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA) in May 2019</a>, the SREC market has been recovering nicely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This legislation requires 50% of Marylandâ€™s energy to come from renewable sources and 14.5% from in-state solar, by 2030.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the passage of CEJA the price has jumped up to $65 and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased to $80. SREC Trade <a href="https://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-markets/maryland/maryland-srec-market-update-2">reports</a> a 23% drop in build-out rate over the previous twelve months. If I had to guess, there's a lot of installations on hold as consumers priorities shift toward their health and that of their families.</p>

<h2>Cost of Electricity</h2>

<p>The cost of electricity over the past couple years has been on the decline, ranging from $0.10 to $0.12 per kilowatt-hour from my utility (including supply, delivery, taxes, and fees).</p>

<p>My effective rate for electricity I produce is $0.18 per kilowatt-hour and falling. Within two years I could easily see my effective rate being less expensive than from my utility.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Discrepancies</h2>

<p>Over a six year period my production meter recorded 350 kWh more than SunPower's monitoring software (roughly 5 kWh/month on average). Occasionally the SunPower hardware needs a reset, has recording issues, or SunPower's data processing backend isn't working properly.</p>

<p>I've adjusted some of my tracking spreadsheets to account for this and allow trueing-up with the production meter periodically as it's a far more accurate instrument.</p>

<h2>Production Shortfalls</h2>

<p>It's possible that the discrepancies listed above could account for <em>some</em> of the production shortfalls I've seen. Even taking the shortfalls into consideration, the system is still only producing 92% of it's warranted output on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>I could submit for my installer to reimburse me for this shortfall. They've given me the runaround the last two years and frankly it isn't worth the hassle.</p>

<h2>Continuing On...</h2>

<p>Six years in, the sun is still shining. I'm still pleased with my decision to install solar PV panels on my home.</p>

<p>If I bought another property, I wouldn't hesitate to install solar PV there as well.</p>
